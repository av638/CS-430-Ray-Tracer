# CS-430-Ray-Tracer
In this fourth project we are adding reflection and refraction to our already created raycaster.

The main has the actual ray casting and the intersection functions as well as the reflect and refraction code.
I was able to get the sphere to properly reflect and refract, but for whatever reason when I apply the same code 
to the plane, changing the sections that need to be changed for the plane, there is no reflection and the 
reflection is removed from the spheres.
