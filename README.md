# CS-430-Ray-Tracer
In this fourth project we are adding reflection and refraction to our already created raycaster.

The main has the actual ray casting and the intersection functions. Everything else helps with the parsing
and the writing. The ppm writer will only write out in p3 format but it does so properly.
